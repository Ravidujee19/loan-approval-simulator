🔹 1. Logistic Regression
Type: Linear model
Pros: Simple, interpretable, fast
Cons: Limited for complex relationships
Why use it? → Good baseline model for credit approval (probability output).


🔹 2. Decision Tree
Type: Tree-based
Pros: Easy to visualize, interpretable
Cons: Can overfit
Why use it? → Good for showing decision rules (“If Credit_History=1 and Income>3000 → Approve”).


🔹 3. Random Forest
Type: Ensemble of Decision Trees
Pros: Strong accuracy, handles categorical + numerical well
Cons: Less interpretable than single tree
Why use it? → Often the best all-around choice for structured datasets like this.


🔹 4. Gradient Boosting (GBM)
Type: Boosted decision trees
Pros: Higher accuracy than Random Forest on structured data
Cons: Slower, more complex
Why use it? → Handles small imbalances and nonlinearities very well.


🔹 5. XGBoost
Type: Optimized Gradient Boosting
Pros: Industry standard, very high performance
Cons: Needs tuning for best results
Why use it? → Widely used in Kaggle competitions for tabular problems.


🔹 6. LightGBM
Type: Gradient boosting (optimized for speed)
Pros: Much faster than XGBoost, works well with large data
Cons: Can be sensitive to small datasets
Why use it? → If dataset grows bigger (more loan data), LightGBM is best.


🔹 7. CatBoost
Type: Gradient boosting (handles categorical features automatically)
Pros: Very accurate, no need for manual encoding
Cons: Training slower than LightGBM
Why use it? → Perfect for your dataset (Education, Gender, Property_Area are categorical).


🔹 8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Type: Maximum-margin classifier
Pros: Good for binary classification
Cons: Slow on big datasets, less interpretable
Why use it? → Could test on small version of your dataset.


🔹 9. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Type: Distance-based
Pros: Very simple, no training step
Cons: Slow on predictions, sensitive to scaling
Why use it? → Baseline comparison only.


🔹 10. Artificial Neural Network (ANN / MLPClassifier)
Type: Feedforward neural net
Pros: Can capture complex patterns
Cons: Needs more data & tuning, less interpretable
Why use it? → If you want to showcase AI/Deep Learning in your system.
